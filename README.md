## Inference in a few lines
We provide a helper class to simplify writing inference pipelines using pre-trained models.
Here is how we would do it. Run this from the `demo` folder:
```python
from maskrcnn_benchmark.config import cfg
from predictor import COCODemo

config_file = "../configs/caffe2/e2e_mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_1x_caffe2.yaml"

# update the config options with the config file
cfg.merge_from_file(config_file)
# manual override some options
cfg.merge_from_list(["MODEL.DEVICE", "cpu"])

coco_demo = COCODemo(
    cfg,
    min_image_size=800,
    confidence_threshold=0.7,
)
# load image and then run prediction
image = ...
predictions = coco_demo.run_on_opencv_image(image)
```

## Perform training on COCO dataset

For the following examples to work, you need to first install `maskrcnn_benchmark`.

You will also need to download the COCO dataset.
We recommend to symlink the path to the coco dataset to `datasets/` as follows

We use `minival` and `valminusminival` sets from [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/blob/master/detectron/datasets/data/README.md#coco-minival-annotations)

```bash
# symlink the coco dataset
cd ~/github/maskrcnn-benchmark
mkdir -p datasets/coco
ln -s /path_to_coco_dataset/annotations datasets/coco/annotations
ln -s /path_to_coco_dataset/train2014 datasets/coco/train2014
ln -s /path_to_coco_dataset/test2014 datasets/coco/test2014
ln -s /path_to_coco_dataset/val2014 datasets/coco/val2014
# or use COCO 2017 version
ln -s /path_to_coco_dataset/annotations datasets/coco/annotations
ln -s /path_to_coco_dataset/train2017 datasets/coco/train2017
ln -s /path_to_coco_dataset/test2017 datasets/coco/test2017
ln -s /path_to_coco_dataset/val2017 datasets/coco/val2017

# for pascal voc dataset:
ln -s /path_to_VOCdevkit_dir datasets/voc
```

P.S. `COCO_2017_train` = `COCO_2014_train` + `valminusminival` , `COCO_2017_val` = `minival`
      

You can also configure your own paths to the datasets.
For that, all you need to do is to modify `maskrcnn_benchmark/config/paths_catalog.py` to
point to the location where your dataset is stored.
You can also create a new `paths_catalog.py` file which implements the same two classes,
and pass it as a config argument `PATHS_CATALOG` during training.

**2. Modify the cfg parameters**

If you experience out-of-memory errors, you can reduce the global batch size. But this means that
you'll also need to change the learning rate, the number of iterations and the learning rate schedule.

Here is an example for Mask R-CNN R-50 FPN with the 1x schedule:
```bash
python tools/train_net.py --config-file "configs/e2e_mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_1x.yaml" SOLVER.IMS_PER_BATCH 2 SOLVER.BASE_LR 0.0025 SOLVER.MAX_ITER 720000 SOLVER.STEPS "(480000, 640000)" TEST.IMS_PER_BATCH 1
```
This follows the [scheduling rules from Detectron.](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/blob/master/configs/getting_started/tutorial_1gpu_e2e_faster_rcnn_R-50-FPN.yaml#L14-L30)
Note that we have multiplied the number of iterations by 8x (as well as the learning rate schedules),
and we have divided the learning rate by 8x.

We also changed the batch size during testing, but that is generally not necessary because testing
requires much less memory than training.
